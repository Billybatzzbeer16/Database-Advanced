### Week 15/02/2021
I started off with installing a virtual machine and Ubuntu on it. I used VirtualBox for this task because we already used it in information security in the first year. After that I had to install python on the VM which wasn't that difficult. The installation of libraries however was a bit more complicated because I couldn't get pip to work so I had to find a different way to install libraries. After figuring this out I could begin on the actual task. I ran into some troubles with finding the right class to scrape. I thought it was easier to scrape the whole table of things I needed but this wasn't easy at all. I then decided to make different variables for each of the needed values. The problem was that the amount had the same class so I had to split them up by myself. I did this by using a for loop and checked if the value contained the word BTC. If so I putted them in a list of amount in Bitcoin and the others in amount in USD. The problem I ran in to however was that the word of the object would always be appended as well. I SolvedÂ  this by appending substrings. After this I placed all this data in a data variable and added it to a pandas data frame. To get the largest amount in USD I sorted the data frame on Amount of BTC because if I did this on Amount of USD the comma's would mess things up. A solution could be to replace the comma's but this would take to much time so I decided to do sort on BTC because if the USD go higher the amount of bitcoin should go up as well. After this I placed all of this in a function and this function in a timer which makes the function run every 60 seconds as requested.
